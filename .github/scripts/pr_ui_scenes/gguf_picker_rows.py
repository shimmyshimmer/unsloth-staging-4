"""Scene: a GGUF repo's quant list in the Model Hub picker.

Serves PR 8222 (a multi-checkpoint repo collapsing to one row per quant) and
PR 8255 (a base quant published at several bit widths), which change the same
surface for different repos -- so the repo is a parameter, not a constant.

PR 8222, `unsloth/LTX-2.3-GGUF`: 63 GGUFs across three checkpoints sharing quant
labels (`<root>/` dev, `distilled/`, `distilled-1.1/`). Before, the picker keyed a
row on the quant token alone: 22 rows, all resolving into `distilled-1.1/`, each
advertising the SUM of all three copies (BF16 at 126 GB for three 42 GB files).

PR 8255, `byteshape/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF`: 18 files, 4 rows, 14 checkpoints
unselectable.

Only Hub listings are read -- no weights -- which makes this the cheapest honest
scene in the set and the right one to develop the harness against.
