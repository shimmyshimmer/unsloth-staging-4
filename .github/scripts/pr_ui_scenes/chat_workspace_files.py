"""Scene: the chat workspace Files panel PR 10798 adds, over a seeded workspace.

The PR adds `GET /api/workspace-files/files` + `/preview` and a
`WorkspaceFilesPanel`. On a thread that has a sandbox session, `chat-page.tsx`
renders a ghost `Button aria-label="Browse workspace files"` reading "Files"
above the thread; clicking it opens
`<aside aria-label="Workspace files">` with a `<h2>Files</h2>` header, Refresh /
Close buttons, an `Input aria-label="Filter files"`, a
`<nav aria-label="Workspace folders">` tree of `<button title={entry.path}>`
(directories carry `aria-expanded`, the selected file `aria-current="true"`) and
either a `<section aria-label="File preview">` or "Select a file to preview it.".

**This pair is ASYMMETRIC and that is the whole design problem.** On the merge
base the button, the aside and both routes DO NOT EXIST, so the obvious scene --
click "Files", assert the panel -- dies on BEFORE with a selector timeout and the
run produces nothing at all. So absence is RECORDED as a fact here rather than
raised on, and the same viewport is photographed either way. The asymmetry only
runs one way: on AFTER a missing panel, a missing entry or an empty preview
RAISES, because the AFTER half is the one whose content this evidence claims.

Three things make the halves comparable, none of them optional:

* **One fixed workspace, seeded on disk on both sides.** The panel over an empty
  workspace says "No files in this workspace yet", which is a weak shot and a
  weak claim. The scene writes the SAME four files with the SAME bytes into the
  session's sandbox workdir on both sides, so the content is a constant and the
  panel is the only moving part.
* **The seeding is verified through the photographed server, on both sides.**
  `GET /api/inference/sandbox/{session}` predates this PR and answers on the
  merge base too, and it resolves the workdir with the very same
  `resolve_sandbox_workdir()` the PR's new route calls. It reports the resolved
  path and the files in it, so a BEFORE side that seeded into a directory the
  server would never have served is caught HERE rather than being written off as
  "well, the panel does not exist on that side anyway". Its file list and sizes
  are the control: identical on both halves.
* **A fixed thread id and a fixed workspace, so nothing visible is per-side.**
  The thread is created through the API with a title and a createdAt that are
  constants, so the sidebar's Recents row reads the same on both halves.

Facts that differ between the sides BY CONSTRUCTION -- the thread id, the
per-home sandbox path, the panel's measured box -- are `_`-prefixed, which is
what keeps them out of the driver's comparison. An un-prefixed one would satisfy
the "some fact moved" guard on its own, without any fact about the UI having
moved.

Cheap by design (`needs_model=False`): no weights, no GPU, no network. The chat
thread is never sent a message, because the Files button is gated on a sandbox
session id derived from the thread id and nothing else.
