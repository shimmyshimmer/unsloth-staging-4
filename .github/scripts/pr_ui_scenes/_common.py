"""Shared plumbing for PR before/after Studio scenes.

Everything here exists because it bit me during the PR 8222 pilot. Each helper
guards one failure mode that produced a screenshot pair which looked perfectly
fine and proved nothing:

  pick_free_ports      a port already held by an unrelated Studio -> launch_studio
                       silently fails to bind, /healthz answers from the WRONG
                       install, and both sides photograph someone else's build
  studio_session       the bootstrap password is written to auth/.bootstrap_password,
                       NOT inlined in the log (so lifecycle's regex finds nothing),
                       and every API 403s with "Password change required" until it
                       is rotated
  assert_showing       a detail panel keeps its previous selection while the click
                       lands on the search box, so the shot is of another model
  open_list            the toolbar format filter also reads "GGUF"; clicking it opens
                       a menu identical on both sides, which photographs as NO CHANGE

The last one is the dangerous class: a wrong selector that still yields a clean
image on both sides is indistinguishable from "the PR changed nothing" unless you
look at the picture. Always look at the picture.
