"""Scene: the Images -> Train tab's "Model family" picker (PR 8196).

PR 8196 adds LTX-2, the first VIDEO family, to the flow-matching DiT LoRA trainer.
The trainer, the routing and the preflight are backend, but one listing decides
whether any of it is reachable by hand: ``family_train_infos()``, which is what
``GET /api/train/diffusion/info`` returns and what the Train panel's "Model family"
Select is built from.

Before this PR that listing walked ``trainable_family_names()``, the IMAGE registry
alone, so a video family could not appear in it however complete its trainer was.
The PR replaces that with ``_all_trainable_family_names()`` -- the image registry's
trainable families UNION ``TRAINABLE_VIDEO_FAMILIES`` -- and drops any family whose
pipeline class the installed diffusers lacks (``family_pipeline_available``).

That last clause is why this scene reads the API as well as photographing the
dropdown: on a diffusers older than 0.39 there is no ``LTX2Pipeline`` and the head
would honestly show no new row. The facts record the diffusers version so a pair
can never be mistaken for the wrong reason.

Listings only: no weights, no GPU, no disk.
