"""Which scene photographs which PR, and what the shot is supposed to prove.

`expect` is the point of this file. A scene that runs cleanly and produces two
identical images is the default failure mode of this whole exercise -- a missed
click, the wrong dropdown, or a Studio that never rebuilt all look like "the PR
changed nothing". Writing down the expected difference BEFORE running turns that
silent failure into a checkable claim.

`needs_model` marks scenes that must load real weights. Those are slow and need a
GPU; the cheap ones (Hub listings only) should be developed first.

`parity` inverts all of that for a PR whose claim is that the UI does NOT change,
e.g. a pure performance fix. Identical halves become the thesis rather than the
default failure, so the driver flips its guards instead of being waved through
with `--allow-identical`: it requires the facts to MATCH, and requires the scene
to have returned content, because a scene that rendered nothing also produces two
matching halves. Set it on the plan; there is nothing to remember at the command
line. `expect` still carries the weight, and on a parity plan it must name
POSITIVE content both halves show, never "no difference".
