"""Scene: what the Hub's On Device tab says before it deletes an image model.

Serves PR 8223 (issue 8116). An image GGUF caches only the denoiser; the text encoders,
VAE and tokenizer come from a separate companion base repo that every quant of the family
shares, and that base is usually the larger half. Three surfaces change, all on the same
tab, so one flow photographs all three:

  1. the On Device toolbar          gains a "Free up space" control
  2. delete the GGUF checkpoint     the dialog gains what it reclaims (4.4 GB) and what it
                                    strands (8.2 GB of shared assets)
  3. delete the shared base repo    refused while a quant is installed, with Delete disabled,
                                    where before it succeeded and left both quants unloadable

The cache is seeded by `scripts/seed_8223_cache.py` into an isolated HF_HOME; both Studios
are launched against that same cache, and this scene never confirms a delete, so the two
sides read an identical, unmutated disk.

No weights are loaded and no GPU is touched: every number here comes from a cache scan.
