"""Scene: the SAME reply bytes rendered by both builds, read back out of the DOM.

For PRs 9012, 9014 and 9054, all three of which are pure performance changes whose
entire claim is that the UI does NOT change. Identical halves are therefore the
THESIS, not the failure, which is what the registry's `parity=True` tells the
driver, and it puts the whole weight on the registry's `expect` strings.

So this scene is written the other way round from the picker scenes: instead of
proving that something MOVED, it has to prove that the specific content named in
`expect` was actually ON SCREEN on both sides. Two matching blank bubbles are the
exact output a missed send, an un-intercepted request or a Studio that never
rebuilt would produce, and they would read as "this PR changed nothing". Every
fact below is therefore read out of the live DOM, and anything missing raises
rather than returning an empty string.

The input is byte-identical on both sides by construction: a fetch shim swaps the
completions request for a crafted SSE body served by an out-of-page HTTP server,
so free-form generation cannot make the two halves render different essays. That
shim needs `open_chat(bypass_csp=True)`, since the served bytes come from another
port and Studio ships `connect-src 'self'`. Everything downstream of the
socket is the real thing -- the real chat adapter, assistant-ui, React, markdown,
Shiki -- built from that side's own tree.

Three payloads, one per PR:

  think_and_placeholder (9012)  a <think> block, an answer, a COMPLETED trailing
                                `${answer}` fragment that must be stripped, and an
                                INCOMPLETE `${unclosed` that must survive. The
                                strip only runs when the adapter decides the
                                request is external, which it does from the
                                selected checkpoint being prefixed `external::`,
                                so `external=True` seeds a connection and selects
                                it. Run non-external the strip is NOT exercised
                                and the facts say so (`strip_exercised`).
  parts_and_tool (9014)         a finished text part, a tool call caught RUNNING
                                at the mid-stream shot and COMPLETE at the settled
                                one, and a closing text part. The running ->
                                complete transition is the point of the pair, so a
                                mid-stream shot that misses it raises.
  plain_thread (9054)           a finished reply with a fenced code block (Shiki on
                                screen) plus a second, truncated turn so the
                                Continue bar renders on the newest message only,
                                with text typed into the composer.

`reply_sha256` is over the settled reply text with the reasoning pane's contents
removed, so the halves can be compared exactly instead of by eye. The reasoning
TRIGGER carries a "Thought for N seconds" duration that is wall clock, not
content, which is why the pane is excluded from the hash and reported separately.
