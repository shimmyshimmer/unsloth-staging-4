"""Keep the turns the rolling context window evicts, and hand them back on request.

Each evicted turn is indexed into a per-thread RAG scope, reusing the store, chunker,
embedder and hybrid retrieval that back attached documents. The stored transcript is
never touched; this is only a search index over turns the projection cannot carry.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to break:

* The archive is CUMULATIVE. Nothing is cleared or re-scoped per compaction, so the fifth
  compaction can still find what the first evicted. On MRCR v2 over 11 compaction events,
  cumulative scored 0.450 against 0.058 for latest-compaction-only.
* Nothing here may break a chat. Every entry point no-ops on failure, because the
  alternative to a degraded archive is a working conversation, not an error.

    the first request after the store or embedder dies would commit a reset claiming the
    dropped turns are searchable while nothing was indexed.

    A probe, not a promise: it cannot see a failure starting after it returns, leaving the
    same one-turn window for a store that dies mid-request (the turns survive anyway, since
    the client re-sends the branch and the write is idempotent).

    The counter is CALLED, not merely constructed. `embedding_identity` is string
    formatting over resolver metadata and `token_counter` hands back a lazy closure, so
    both reported a healthy archive while the embedder could not initialize; calling it
    forces the load.

    And a real ENCODE, because the tokenizer is not the forward pass. `_st_token_counter`
    reaches only `_get(model).tokenizer`, so a runtime encode failure with no llama binary
    to fall back to -- CUDA OOM against the co-resident chat model, a driver fault, the
    half-precision path -- left this answering yes while `archive_turns` was about to
    raise and swallow it. The reset would already have dropped the history and told the
    model it was searchable, and the epoch is replayed from the boundary, so the loss is
    durable rather than one turn.

    NOT memoised across requests. A time-boxed cache handed back a stale yes for the whole
    window after the store or embedder died, and one request inside it is enough: the epoch
    starts, `archive_turns` swallows the write failure, and the fitted prompt has already
    dropped the turns it says are searchable. The caller memoises per fit instead, which is
    the only span where the answer cannot change under it.

    `"x"` rather than `""`: an empty input is documented to upset the llama embedding
    server. An encode rather than `dim()`, which caches and on the sentence-transformers
    path runs no forward at all -- that would reintroduce exactly the bug this closes.

    a recall could answer with it: measured, `Foo` after it was corrected to `foo`, still
    validated. The two sides here are a stored render and the live text of the same

    retires the stale copy -- the edit changes the digest, so it is written as a new
    document and the branch filter is the only thing that could have dropped the old one.

    `strip()` and not `rstrip()`, even though trimming each probe also discards leading
    indentation. Keeping leading whitespace looks tighter and is worse: `render_turn`
    strips the whole message, so a live turn beginning with a space or a newline then
    starts its run at a non-zero offset and `_document_matches_one_run` retires it.
    Measured, `   hello there` and a pasted block opening on a newline both went from
    live to retired, which is a silent loss of recall on exactly the pasted code that
    tends to matter.

    Indentation-only edits are therefore still tolerated, in both directions: probes are
    matched per line and as substrings, so leading whitespace never decides. Closing that
    needs the probe splitter to carry offsets, which is a bigger change than this bug
    warrants. Lexical search does its own tokenising and never reads this.
