"""Shared factory vocabulary for the route isolation matrix.

A factory names a seeder that creates the resource inside the acting account and returns the
route's path parameters. Actor expectations default to the isolation contract: owner and other
account 404, the resource's account the success code, unauthenticated 401/403, deactivated 401.
A route whose real contract differs states the deviation with a one-line reason.
