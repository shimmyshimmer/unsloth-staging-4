"""Which account a request, job or thread is acting for.

One ContextVar, bound by the auth dependency and carried by asyncio tasks, but
deliberately NOT inherited by new threads or processes: those rebind through
``run_as`` / ``account_thread``. It defaults to the installation owner, so a
single-account install behaves exactly as it did before accounts existed.

Keyed by immutable ``account_id``, never username: the next holder of a reused name
would otherwise inherit the old files.
